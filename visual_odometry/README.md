# Visual Odometry

Visual odometry is an odometry that use visual information form camera only. This part is mainly about feature point method used in visual odometry.

## Principle

* [ORB feature](./principle/ORB_feature.md)

## Practice

* [ORB implementation with OpenCV](./orb_cv)
* [ORB implementation by self](./orb_self)
* [EPnP implementation with OpenCV](./epnp_opencv)
* [PnP via BA with manual GaussNewton](./pnp_manual_gaussnewton)
* [PnP via BA with g2o](./pnp_g2o)
* [ICP via SVD method using Eigen](./icp_svd)
* [ICP via BA with g2o](./icp_g2o)
