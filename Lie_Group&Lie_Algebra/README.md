# Lie Group & Lie Algebra

The rotation matrix has constraints itself (orthogonal and determinant is 1). Therefore, when using them as the optimization variables, there will be extra constrains that make the optimization harder. We hope that we can turn pose estimation problem into unconstrained optimization problem with the converting relation between Lie group and Lie algebra.
